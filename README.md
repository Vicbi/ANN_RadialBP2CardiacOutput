# ANN_RadialBP2CardiacOutput
### Cardiac Output Prediction with ANN-Enabled Estimation

This repository hosts scripts for the development and testing of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-enabled estimation method to predict cardiac output from non-invasive calibrated and uncalibrated radial pressure data.

**Overview**
Cardiac output is a critical physiological parameter that measures the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit of time. This repository provides tools to develop and evaluate a method that leverages artificial neural networks to estimate cardiac output based on non-invasive radial pressure data. The estimation method employs both calibrated and uncalibrated radial pressure data as input features for the ANN model.
